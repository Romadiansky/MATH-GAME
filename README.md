# Math_Game

> **"What's the difference between people who enjoy Math_Game and those who do not? Sum people know how to have fun."** *-Old Sage*

Math_Game is a simple Ruby CLI game that allows two people to square off by showing off their tight addition skills. A battle of wits that leaves only one human standing.

>Disclaimer: in the opinion of the creators of this game, 'wits' is a function of how well one can put two and two together.


## Instructions
